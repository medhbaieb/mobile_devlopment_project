Handicap should Never be the reason for misfortune. That's why we should always try to better the lives of those who have difficulties going by their daily life. And this where our app comes in. MyEyeIsYours will help ease the life of those who are visually impaired. Through its various functionalities and services, unsighted people can have assistance doing everyday tasks. Our app will also give the chance to those who want to volunteer and give a hand to those who need it.

## Getting Started
So first, we should get flutter installed(Which is the platform used to create our application).
If you have never used Flutter before, I suggest you follow this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tun0HUHaDuE&ab_channel=TonyDavid). 
Once done , we can import this repository into your pc (I suggest using github desktop for that matter) and then using the command line
```cmd
flutter pub get
```
After that, you are good to go. You can Run our application on an emulator or on web and since our app backend is running on firebase no backend configuration is needed.

## User interface/User Experience

So it all starts with the sign up. And this is the only step where someone who can't see will need assistance to use the app. After Filling out his information, his login will be saved so he want to have to redo it each time he uses the app. This process will be even easier if we add a voice instruction, but for now he'll have to do it the traditional way.
